        <h1>About the Game</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our <span class="highlight">Neon Dash</span> 2-player experience where the objective is to
            either catch or evade your opponent!</p>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you're the <span class="red">Red Player</span>, your goal is to touch the <span class="blue">Blue
                    Player</span> to score a point.</li>
            <li>If you're the <span class="blue">Blue Player</span>, you need to avoid being touched by the <span
                    class="red">Red Player</span> for 30 seconds to score a point.</li>
            <li>The first player to reach <span class="highlight">6 points</span> wins the game!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="red">Red Player</span> moves with <kbd>W</kbd> (up), <kbd>A</kbd> (left), <kbd>S</kbd>
                (down), and <kbd>D</kbd> (right).</li>
            <li><span class="blue">Blue Player</span> moves with the <kbd>↑</kbd> (up), <kbd>↓</kbd> (down),
                <kbd>←</kbd> (left), and <kbd>→</kbd> (right) arrow keys.
            </li>
